## CUNY Virtual Hackathon 2022
# Cuny Coin

## Inspiration
Our motivation for taking on this challenge stems from witnessing the financial struggles that students face, which often hinder their ability to complete their education on time. One of our team members, who serves as an Academic Advisor at CUNY, experiences firsthand the difficulties students encounter. We are excited about this project as it recognizes and rewards students throughout their academic journey.

## What it does
CUNY Coin enables students and faculty to access, purchase, and track their own CUNY coin. Additionally, it provides the ability to monitor the prices of other cryptocurrencies. Students and faculty can utilize the cryptocurrency to purchase school supplies, metro cards, meals, and cover other educational expenses.

## How we built it
We constructed CUNY Coin using a web application and SQL for student registration. Additionally, we leveraged the Ropsten test network for deploying our CUNY Coin solution.

## Challenges we ran into
Our main challenge revolved around sourcing suitable online resources that aligned with our objectives and desired implementation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Participating in this hackathon marks a significant accomplishment for both our team and individuals, as it represents our first hackathon experience. We take pride in successfully overcoming obstacles together and developing an application that we are proud of.

## What we learned
Engaging with cryptocurrencies and integrating them into real-world applications provided us with valuable insights. We gained knowledge on implementing and utilizing cryptocurrencies within a network for practical purposes.

## What's next for CUNY Coin
Upon achieving success, our next step involves expanding the usage of CUNY Coin to SUNY, which encompasses 65 campuses. Additionally, we envision the potential for out-of-state public college systems to adopt a similar model to CUNY Coin. Notably, a handful of schools such as UPenn, King's College, and UC Berkeley already accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. By extending CUNY Coin to a diverse range of campuses, we aim to revolutionize the acceptance of cryptocurrency within the education sector.
