# cunycoin

## Inspiration
**The inspiration for taking this challenge was seeing how students in every day life are not able to maintain classes due to financial constraints, setting them back semesters and even years in their education. One of our team members is CUNY Staff as an Academic Advisor who sees first-hand the challenges students face to complete their degree in a timely manner. She is excited that this project recognizes and rewards students every step of the way.**

## What it does
**It allows students and faculty to access, purchase, and track their _CUNY coin_. As well as allows you to track the price of other cryptos. Students and faculty can use the crypto to purchase school supplies, metro cards, food, and cover other school related costs.**

## How we built it
**We build the CUNY Coin by using the a web app and SQL to register students. We were also able to use the Ropsten test network to deploy our CUNY Coin.**

## Challenges we ran into
**Our challenges were finding the proper online resources that catered to our challenge and how we wanted to implement them.**

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
**Our first accomplishment is that as a team and an individual this is our first hackathon that were excited to be a part of, and coming together as a team to overcome difficult obstacles and creating an application that were proud of.**

## What we learned
**We learned how to engage with cryptocurrency and implement it into a network for real world usage.**

## What's next for CUNY Coin
**When proven successful, expanding it to SUNY, which comprises of 65 campuses. Out-of-state public college systems can also be modeled after the CUNY Coin. A handful of schools accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment: UPenn, Kingâ€™s College, UC Berkeley to name a few. CUNY Coin will be ground breaking in extending it to a dynamic number of campuses for crypto to be accepted.**
